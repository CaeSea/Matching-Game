# Game Description

I have used HTML, CSS & plain JS to create the game. By selecting and manipulating the DOM using JS
the game shuffles the cards on each page reload or when the restart button is clicked. The game
then uses functions to check arrays for matching cards. If the cards match the card is left with a class
that shows the card face up. If the card does not match then a class is added to the card to flip the card and
flip it back over, hiding the card face. The game is complete when all cards have been matched, this causes
a congratulations modal to pop up.
